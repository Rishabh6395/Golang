# GoLang Playground

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This repository is my personal playground for learning the Go programming language (also known as Golang). Here, I experiment with Go basics, explore its features, and build small projects as I progress.

## Why Go?

- Simple and clean syntax
- Fast compilation and execution
- Great support for concurrency
- Strong standard library
- Widely used in cloud, networking, and backend development

## What you'll find here

- Sample Go programs and scripts
- Notes and code snippets from my learning journey
- Experiments with Go modules, packages, and concurrency

## Getting Started

If you want to try out the code:

1. Install [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
2. Clone this repository
3. Run any `.go` file using:

   ```sh
   go run filename.go
